## Core Architectures Used

### BGE (BAAI General Embedding) Architecture

**What it is:**
- Single unified encoder model based on RoBERTa-large
- 1024-dimensional dense embeddings
- Multi-task pre-training (retrieval, clustering, classification, semantic similarity)

**Technical Details:**
```
Model: BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5
Parameters: 335M
Embedding Dimension: 1024
Architecture: RoBERTa-large + pooling layers
Training: Contrastive learning on 1B+ text pairs
```

**Strengths:**

- State-of-the-art performance on MTEB benchmarks (63.36 average score)
- Zero-shot transfer to new domains
- Memory efficient (one model vs two)

**Weaknesses:**
- Not specifically optimized for question-answering
- Fixed representation (doesn't adapt to domain-specific patterns without retraining)
- Requires GPU for optimal performance

**Why we chose it:**
- Simplicity of single-encoder architecture

### Transformer Architecture (in LLMs)

**What it is:**
- Self-attention based architecture for sequence modeling
- Used in System A for answer generation (LLaMA 2, GPT models)

**Technical Components:**
```
Multi-Head Attention: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V
Feed-Forward Networks: FFN(x) = ReLU(xW₁ + b₁)W₂ + b₂
Layer Normalization: LN(x) = γ(x-μ)/σ + β
Positional Encoding: PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/10000^(2i/d))
```

**Strengths:**
- Captures long-range dependencies
- Parallel processing (unlike RNNs)
- Transfer learning capabilities
- State-of-the-art generation quality

**Weaknesses:**
- O(n²) complexity with sequence length
- Large memory footprint (7B+ parameters)
- High inference latency (~300ms for generation)
- Limited context window (4k-32k tokens)

**Our Implementation:**
- Used only for final answer generation in System A
- Not used for retrieval (too slow)
- Supports multiple model backends (local and API-based)

### Knowledge Graph Architecture

**What it is:**
- Directed graph structure storing entities and relationships
- NetworkX-based implementation

**Structure:**
```python
Node: {
    'id': entity_id,
    'type': entity_type,
    'embedding': 1024-dim vector,
    'metadata': {...}
}
Edge: {
    'type': relationship_type,
    'confidence': float,
    'source_paper': paper_id
}
```

**Strengths:**

**Core Mechanism:**
```
Hebbian Update: Δw = η × activation × feedback × (1 - w)

Learning Rate Decay: η(t) = η₀ / (1 + γt)
```

**Strengths:**
- Learns from user interactions
- No backpropagation needed
- Fast inference (~120ms)
- Improves over time
- Domain adaptation without retraining

**Weaknesses:**

## Architectures We Considered But Rejected

### DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval)

**What it is:**
- Facebook's dual-encoder architecture
- Separate BERT models for queries and passages
- Trained with contrastive learning

**Architecture:**
```
Query Encoder: BERT → [CLS] → Dense layer → Query embedding
Passage Encoder: BERT → [CLS] → Dense layer → Passage embedding
Similarity: dot_product(q_embedding, p_embedding)
```

**Why we rejected it:**
1. **Complexity**: Two models to maintain and synchronize
2. **Training data**: Requires large-scale question-passage pairs
3. **Memory**: 2× the parameters of single encoder
4. **Domain specificity**: Poor transfer to scientific text
5. **Maintenance overhead**: Version compatibility issues

**When DPR would be better:**
- Pure QA systems with abundant training data
- Fixed query-document relationship patterns
- Systems where query/document asymmetry is strong

---

### ColBERT (Contextualized Late Interaction)

**What it is:**
- Token-level dense retrieval
- Stores all token embeddings
- MaxSim operation for scoring

**Architecture:**
```
Score(q, d) = Σᵢ maxⱼ(qᵢ · dⱼ)
Storage: n_docs × n_tokens × embedding_dim
```

**Why we rejected it:**
1. **Storage explosion**: 100× more storage than document-level embeddings
2. **Computational cost**: Token-level matching is expensive
3. **Complexity**: Harder to implement and maintain
4. **Limited gains**: Marginal improvement not worth the cost

**When ColBERT would be better:**
- Fine-grained matching requirements
- Unlimited storage budget
- Need for token-level explanations

---

### End-to-End Transformer RAG

**What it is:**
- Single transformer model for both retrieval and generation
- Examples: RETRO, Atlas, RAG-Token

**Why we rejected it:**
1. **Scale limitations**: Can't handle millions of documents
2. **Training cost**: Requires massive computational resources
3. **Update complexity**: Adding new documents requires retraining
4. **Black box**: No interpretable retrieval step

**When it would be better:**
- Small, fixed document collections
- Unlimited compute budget
- No interpretability requirements

---

### Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

**What it is:**
- Neural networks operating on graph structures
- Message passing between nodes
- Examples: GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT

**Why we rejected (for main architecture):**
1. **Over-smoothing**: Deep GNNs lose discriminative power
2. **Scalability**: Full-batch training doesn't scale
3. **Dynamic graphs**: Hard to handle growing knowledge graphs
4. **Limited gains**: Traditional graph algorithms sufficient for our needs

**Partial adoption:**
- Light GNN-inspired propagation in SEAL
- Future consideration for relation prediction
